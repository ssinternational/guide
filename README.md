# setting up the repo
1. For any kind of new GitHub Account we have to set up a new ssh key 
2. Follow links or guides on how to set your new ssh key against a new github account 
3. Clone the repository only after a new ssh key is generated 
  3.1. unless a new ssh key is generated from the machine we won't be able to git push to the remote repo
